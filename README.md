# TaskSync

> ðŸ§  Fun fact: The name and project idea was generated with ChatGPT.

A mini-project to practice the tech stack for my Internship @ Spring Valley.

### About the Project

This application would allow multiple users to **manage their tasks and due dates together in real-time**.

The application could also use websockets to provide instant updates and notifications to all users when a task is added, updated, or completed. The users would need to be authenticated to access the To-Do List, and the tasks could be stored in a database for persistence.
